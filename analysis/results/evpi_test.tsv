grub 2 splash screen is n't showing in hidden mode until i press a key using lucid , in the form of turnkey core . i 'm setting up grub to boot into windows by default , with an option to boot into ubuntu as a recovery mode , with a script to restore a default image to the windows partition.the idea is to have a splash screen which tells the user to hold shift for recovery options , otherwise it 'll just boot to windows.unfortunately , while i can get my splash screen to work , it does n't show up until i press a key -- does n't seem to matter which key , as arrow keys , letters , and numbers all seem to work . at that point , the splash screen shows up and displays at the top left corner -- this appears to be the grub_hidden_timeout , and the number updates every time i press a key ; otherwise , it remains static until the actual countdown has finished . ( i guess this indicates that it is also not showing the countdown , which it should be doing , as grub_hidden_timeout_quiet is set to false . ) everything functions normally from this point : if i hold shift , the menu is displayed , otherwise it boots into windows.got the menu to be hidden in multi-os mode by using # 11here.any ideas ? clarification : my issue is that the splash screen does not appear until i press a key . i need the splash screen to show up on its own.contents of /etc/default/grub and /boot/grub/grub.cfg availablehere	can you anyway get the terminal or cli prompt ?	did i understand you correctly when you say there is no recovery mode ?	what one of the three options did you use ?	did you enable usb boot in the bios ?	huh ?	hi , could you be more specific about what you 're editing ?	any feed-back on above comment ?	does the livecd work ?	plymouth and gdm ?	what happens if you change grub_cmdline_linux to `` '' and run update-grub ?

how do i configure dhclient for comcast /64 prefix ? i did have everything working , but when i updated my router to a supported version of ubuntu , it broke ( ubuntu 14.4 ) where things go wrong is dhclient never grabs a /64 . it either gabs the ip for my external interface or it tries to gab the /64 on the internal interface.i think the problem is in /etc/dhcp/dhclient6.confinterface `` eth2 '' { send dhcp6.ia-pd 1 ; script `` /etc/dhclient-exit-hooks '' ; } eth2 is my external interface , i have my exit hooks set to config eth0 . i do have networkmanager mange set to trueif i rundhclient -6 -p eth2it gives me my prefix , but it does n't add the address to eth0	if you are running `dhclient` on eth2 , why would you expect it to do anything with eth0 ?	what is the problem you are facing ?	ok , does it actually change you ip ?	do you mind letting us have a look at : `cat /etc/network/interfaces` ?	it looks like you do not get an dhcp address . is it possible you contact the network administrator ?	can you add the contents of your /etc/network/interfaces file to your question ?	is this a machine or a virtual ( kvm , xen , vmware , openvz ) machine ?	when you connect from where ?	so your problem is you want to start that . but you can not ? i am understart ?	can you do a manual `sudo ifup -- verbose eth0` to see where things go wrong ?

packages have unmet dependencies when trying to install anything i 'm running ubuntu 14.04 lts . i 've recently run into this problem with several applications , it seems to happen to anything i need to update or install . i just gave up the first 2 or 3 times this happened after trying a few solutions to no avail , but now i 'm having the same issue with steam trying to update , which i use quite a lot . i 've looked through dozens of posts about similar issues and tried a lot of solutions and nothing seems to work.the error i get when trying to update steam is : some packages could not be installed . this may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of incoming . the following information may help to resolve the situation : the following packages have unmet dependencies : libgl1-mesa-dri : i386 : depends : libllvm3.4 : i386 but it is not going to be installed depends : libstdc++6 : i386 ( & gt ; = 4.6 ) but it is not going to be installed recommends : libtxc-dxtn-s2tc0 : i386 but it is not going to be installed or libtxc-dxtn0 : i386 e : unable to correct problems , you have held broken packages.i get the same thing but with some different packages listed for other programs i 've had this problem with , but do n't have those error messages on hand but could probably reproduce them if that would help , it seems to be the same issue though.i 've tried runningsudo apt-get update , sudo apt-get upgrade , sudo apt-get dist-upgradeboth withsudo apt-get autoremovebefore	and what happens if you say 'n ' to the solution ?	whats the outputs of `dpkg -- print-architecture` and `dpkg -- print-foreign-architectures` ?	did you have trusty-updates enabled at any point ?	if you use the graphical package manager , does n't add the required packages automatically ?	can you provide the whole terminal output ?	sudo dpkg -reconfigure all ? ?	is your ubuntu i386 ?	why not just install steam from their website ?	can you please add some formatting to this to make it readable or perhaps pastebin this post ?	what was the output of `apt-cache policy libgl1-mesa-dri : i386 libgl1-mesa-glx : i386` ?

how to get a command to output the contents into terminal , and my system clipboard let 's say i have an alias on my system which i often use to tell me my system information , the alias is `systeminfo` , and it executes `lsb_release -a` which outputs : no lsb modules are available . distributor id : ubuntu description : ubuntu 15.04 release : 15.04 codename : vivid now because i use this very often , and i then copy and paste the information into my askubuntu questions , it would be very useful if upon execution of the command , for the output to not only be printed to the terminal window , but also be copied to my system clipboard , so that i can save time , and not need to select the text and then copy and paste that here . so i was wondering how that could be achieved ? how do i make it so that not only is it printed on screen , but also copied to the system clipboard ? preferably , i would like this question to be answered with a script which asks me if i want the information to be copied to my system clipboard in addition to being displayed on screen , but i can of course write up that script , so it would just be for convenience and to save time .	which de are you using ? . are you using some clipboard manager ( like klipeer ) ?	does n't arrow up help ? or do you need part of the result ?	what exactly you did ?	paste the commands into a bash script in a text editor , then execute the script from the tty ?	why not just use `prtscr` , paste that in and crop it there ?	the same with right click , copy ?	does the `-v` flag do anything ?	are you using the `` clip to onenote '' addon for firefox ?	do you want both ctrl+shift+v and shift+ins to paste the clipboard in gnome terminal ?	did you quit vim between typing `` +y on visual selection and trying to paste outside vim ?

changed partition table while installing linux distro alongside windows 7. can not boot into windows or access files i installed elementary os last night and in the process have potentially messed up my hard drive . right now all i care about is being able to copy over important files that are still on the windows partition ( could have saved a lot of trouble doing this before i know ... ) .i 'm currently running ubuntu from a usb so i do n't do anything else stupid . opening up disks shows /dev/sda3 ( windows partition ) as having an unknown file system . the problem is the partition is too big ( 227gb ) for me to be able to copy it anywhere ( actual amount of files i need saving is max 1gb ) . as a result i 'm nervous about trying any methods i see online as they 're only single use cases . testdisk has come up a lot , although i have so many partitions i do n't know what is important.windows does n't show up in grub or os-prober and i ca n't mount any partitions since it does n't recognise the file system as ntfs even when i specify.also , i think there are way too many partitions on the drive . i count 7:1 : 105mb - efi system2 : 134mb - microsoft reserved3 : 227gb - basic data4 : 11gb - basic data5 : 4gb - basic data6 : 5.2mb - bios boot7 : 8.6gb - linux swapthe only partitions with known content are 4 and 7 , which are ext4 and swap.i usedthis guidefor separating the partitions , after i freed space on the c drive in windows disk manager.attempting to mount the sda3 usingsudo mount -t ntfs	do you know why windows suddenly stopped booting ? are you sure the drive is n't just failing ?	how big is the drive , and do you remember the partition layout before you messed it up ?	do you see that really for every partitions , or only for the logical ones ?	does the pen drive boot on another system ?	just wondering , did you make sure the hidden system partition was moved correctly ?	do you keep any backups of your `` hole life '' ?	does the output of the dmesg command tell you something ?	what is `/dev/sda3` used for ?	so is mcafee a fde solution ?	did you get any further with this ?

in need of a unique remote desktop/vnc solution i was wondering if there was a solution already created that would be all web browser based without having the need to connect to anything else other than the web server port if you were the client.ex : the server that has the vnc server on it , also has a built in web server which is a part of the vnc program . is there a solution where the vnc server on that machine can stream its content to the web server using flash or something so that clients can just goto the web server and control the machine from there ( using the flash interface and only communicating via http , no other sockets ) without having to connect to the vnc server itself ? the thing is , i need this to all work as if you were just viewing a normal web page on the internet . there are network restrictions on the clients end that do not allow any tunnelling , anything other than http traffic on http ports , ssl vpn 's , etc .	, why adding osx tag for this question ? not linux , rather ?	java is very uncommon ?	what operating system ?	why not set up a pair of static ips on the direct link ?	is this a terminal server ?	hmm . where is your internet connection ?	can you just add an entry to `/etc/hosts` so `server-c` resolves to `server-b` 's address ?	also , are you connecting the virtual server to the vpn or your desktop to the vpn ?	what web serving software are you using ? what does the config for that setup look like ?	if you set it back to what it was , does it work again ?

configuration for public ( external ) access to ubuntu guest on esxi 5 i am setting up a demo system on a leased dedicated server . system consists of : esxi host with 1 nic assigned ( so 1 static ip ) 64 bit ubuntu guest as serveri installed and configured the system and the current network topology has : physical adaptera management network where i see the public ip assigned that is given to me by dedicated server providervirtual machine port group where my guest is runningfinally a vswitch between physical adapter and networks mentioned abovei can access to esxi host , from the vsphere client i can access my ubuntu guest as well . guest has access to web ( verified by pinging ) .my question : what kind of basic setup would allow external users to access services running on the ubuntu guest ? before asking this question i browsed a bit and scanned through vmware documentations . i have seen : port forwarding via routerhowever i do not have control over the router.using pfsensewell this one is looking like a solution but a bit more complicated then i expected.are there any simpler ways to accomplish my goal ? note : i am a software developer with a bit familiarity of computer networks , virtualization and linux . therefore i would really appreciate simple solutions ( if possible ) , explanations/directions on the topic .	are you referring to the graphical ( gui ) guest login ? or some other services like http ?	does it work if you set the network adapter to `` bridged adapter '' for the vm ?	is the host 's adapter in promiscuous mode ?	how did two devices get the same mac address ?	is the `` non-bridgeable wlan0 '' a kvm thing ?	i 'm a little confused . how are the host and guest on different physical networks ?	what is your **actual question** ?	i assume you have installed the vm additions ( i.e . the drivers ) right ?	why are n't you using nat , which would solve the issue ?	are you testing from inside your network , or externally ?

how do raid controllers determine which disk is faulty ? so it occurred to me that using xor parity i can not determine which disk is faulty in a stripe set.assume that one of the disks in the set is silently flipping bits on the platters ( aka bit rot ) , say for example due to bad firmware . the disk is not failing or reporting bad blocks , but it occasionally commits to disk something else than it was input.using xor , like any other checksum , will not say which disk in the stripe was the cause of the bad parity calculation , but you know one of the disks has a problem.this scenario must be solved some how , given the constraints of raid 5 , but honestly it eludes me . i can imagine that raid-6 with horizontal ( raid-4'ish ) and diagonal parity can triangulate the bad blocks and show what disk contained the bad area ... . but this question pertains to raid-5 sets.thank you in advance .	just a thought - is having a large amount of ram and using a ramdisk an option ?	is this software or hardware raid ?	what type of raid exactly ?	can you post a picture of the physical disk details and the virtual disk details ?	what raid controller do you have ? also what distribution of linux ?	number of drives ? drive interface type ?	it says more than `` the drive is failing '' what attributes is it failing exactly ?	how much speed is enough ?	what do you want to achieve ?	update rst ?

determining the cause of a windows service state change how can the process/service that started or stopped a service be determined ? for example , i am finding that recently , the computer browser , server , and workstation services ( as well as the function-discovery services ) keep starting . i stop them , but then a few minutes later , they are running again . i have already tried disabling things like network shares , netbios , home group , and every related thing that i can think of , but this ( new ) behavior is frustrating , and all the more so because i dont knowwhatis starting them . if i could figure out what process/service is starting them , then i would at least have a hint of where to look.no , the windows event log is not helpful because it says nothing about who/what started the service ; the most information it gives is thatsourcefield usually says service control manager , but that says nothing about what asked the sc to start/stop the service.is there a way to have the service controller log state changes or something ?	is the question why are you getting the message or why ca n't you update your policies ?	are you sure it did n't start or perhaps the process died or was killed after starting ?	is there a need to load the service under the user account ?	what does the dependencies information on the service say ?	is there another service that it relies on that is not starting/failing ?	what does `/var/log/sshd.log` say ?	what happens when remote computers try to connect to shares ? do you get an error ?	can i assume that you do n't want any networking at all ? also , what version of windows ?	this also happens in *recovery mode* ? and , recently was updated some hardware drive ?	is this a business application ?
basic program on samba share gets 'access denied ' when launching other process this is the situation . we have a synology nas ( running dsm 5.0 ) hosting a windows file share called `general` . this folder 's permissions are set as in the screenshot : ! [ 'general ' folder synology permissions ] [ 1 ] this folder is used as a mapped network drive on windows 7 ( 32-bit ) clients ( mapped as `z : ` ) . no authentication is needed for this share . i.e . everyone can access it . a legacy microsoft basic 7 program houses on this mapped drive . this program itself ( say `program.exe` ) functions correctly . it runs , can create files and folders , etc . no problem there . the problem rises when the program creates a temporary file ( say `invoice.txt` ) and then tries to launch another process , that is printing the created text file in a nice way . according to the program 's developer , it uses `shell z : \invoice.exe` to launch this process . what the program shows when this is executed , is : `access denied` . the weird thing is that when i run `invoice.exe` manually from windows explorer , all goes well ( i.e . the invoice is printed ) . i have no clue what is going wrong . what i 've tried so far : * disabled uac . * added the ip address of the synology to internet explorer 's trusted websites . * ran `program.exe` as an administrator ( this worked only after [ sharing mapped drives with all users ] [ 2 ] ) . * changed the permissions of the folder as shown in the screenshot . its directory	if you set the permissions you want on the linux side , what does icacls then show ?	the share is actually on the osx box ?	what exactly is not working ?	does the directory you 're sharing is inside a directory junction ?	why are they in both groups ?	can you write the answer you promised ?	is the domain user a local admin or backup operator on the windows server ?	what error you are getting while typing `mount -a` ?	could you check that you are really using a fast ethernet line ?	is program.exe able to successfully run invoice.exe when the nas is not involved ?

excel formula / concatenate inconsistency i was making a histogram today , and this pc does n't have the analysis toolkit and for whatever reason i did n't feel like tracking it down and installing it . so i found myself with a column of raw data and a column of bin values to use , and i wrote this : =countifs ( $ a $ 1 : $ a $ 10 , concatenate ( `` > = '' , $ b1 ) , $ a $ 1 : $ a $ 10 , concatenate ( `` < `` , $ b2 ) ) in other words , count the cells in my raw data range if they are above the lower bin and below the next one . this did not work - every count returns zero . if , instead , i pulled the concat into its own column ( so bins are in b and i have in c : `concatenate ( `` > = '' , b1 ) ` and in column d i have `concatenate ( `` < `` , b1 ) ` and then edit the histogram formula to reference the new intermediates , the countifs works again . =countifs ( $ a $ 1 : $ a $ 10 , c1 , $ a $ 1 : $ a $ 10 , d2 ) i feel like there is some lesson about how the excel formula parser is working under the hood in this that i should have internalized so it does n't sneak up and kill me one day . does anyone understand what 's actually going on here ?	does the cell have bold formatting applied ?	are your raw data strings ?	so the first situation also would not be flagged ?	do you **need** the result value in column a ?	can you add more details , maybe also with an image ?	is there an example database you can upload somewhere and make available that demonstrates the problem ?	are you familiar with r1c1 style references ?	and is it working ? if not , how is it failing ? what do your data look like ?	are all the rows the same length ?	are you working with numbers or text ?
cross-distro nfs mount not fully writeable in ubuntu i 'm relatively new to setting up nfs mounts and i 'm trying to get things started in the aws cloud . i ultimately want to have a centos box which serves as the nfs server and can have different sorts of machines ( ubuntu or centos ) access the nfs share with full read/write access . i 've got it somewhat working , but right now i ca n't write to files on the ubuntu client that were n't created/last modified on the ubuntu system . ( as a test , i just created a text file on the ubuntu client which was fine . if i then modify it on a centos system , i can read it in ubuntu fine but i ca n't write to it any more . ) configuration : ============== on the centos server my /etc/exports file is as follows : /hello * ( rw , async , no_root_squash , no_subtree_check , fsid=0 ) ( i just used the wildcard for now for ease of access - only systems in my specific aws security group can actually access the nfs ports . ) the config options were somewhat brought together from different guides on the internets . i read somewhere that the fsid=0 is key to getting the share to be mountable in ubuntu . i then exported with `exportfs -a` on both an ubuntu and centos client , i made the directory ( with superuser/as root ) `/mnt/mymnt` then ran : mount -t nfs4.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com : / /mnt/mymnt to mount the share . permissions =========== on the centos server , the shared directory permissions look like : * ( from ls -l / : ) * drwxrwxrwx . 2 1000 1000 4096 apr 24 16:13	are the nfs server 's export settings correct ?	what are the permissions on `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key` ?	what does `df | grep dbf` ( without the -h ) return ?	whats the key files name ?	what is the share 's file system ?	does n't look like a standard cd to me ... .what is '-su : ' ?	what kind of filesystem is this ? its not fat or ntfs is it ?	your original command should work . can you do a `ls -la` of your directory ?	ok , could you also post the output of `grep -v `` # '' /etc/samba/smb.conf` on the nas ?	can you check to which groups your user belongs on the different systems ?

how to use cmd 's tab autocomplete effectively ? i 've used the bash shell on linux for years and i 'm very fast with it . by frequently appealing for autocomplete by hitting the tab key , i 'm able to write long commands in few keystrokes.recently at my job i 've started using the windows command prompt and cmd . i 'm very slow in cmd . it has an autocomplete feature , but it works differently . i think i understand how it works , but i do n't understand how to use it effectively , in fact it often slows me down . so i ask , how to use how to use cmd 's autocomplete effectively ? let me give an example . first i 'll describe how i use bash , then how itryto use cmd , and what goes wrong.suppose the folders in the current directory have names made from a continent and a country , eg.africa-nigeria , asia-india , europe-france , and that i want to change folder toeurope-norway.the way bash 's autocomplete works is that the tab key expands only if there is a unique expansion . otherwise , nothing happens , but you can press tab a second time to list possible expansions.so to move to norway in bash , i typecdand then make the following keystrokes : etabforeurope-ntab ( nothing happens ) tabagain . it listseurope-netherlandsandeurope-norwayas potential expansions.otabforeurope-norway.great ! thanks bash.however , when i try the same keys in cmd , it expandsetabtoeurope-albania , which happens to be the first folder beginning 'e ' , but is n't the folder i wanted ! what should i do nowis it possible to make albania into norway ? or must i cancel the command withescapeand type everything from scratch ?	does it help if you enter a backslash first , like this : `\ps -aux` ?	so i assume you are using an rdp connection into a terminal server ?	what if you type a capital h ?	i tried it out myself and bash responds normally . but keep in mind that ` ?	what is the behavior you are currently getting ? does it work as is without sub dirs ?	what were the first entries replaced with ? could you provide a screenshot of an example maybe ?	workaround : what about `mypath=folder/is/deep/down/there/` , `vim $ mypath/myfile.js` ?	any example ? which scripts are you running and where ?	can you use a menu , eg . batch menu ?	gvim version . show screenshot . run processmonitor and look for `process start` events . what is started ?
the windows registry - why ( and where ) does it exist ? was talking to a friend about the registry , and realized i could n't remember the issues microsoft was trying to solve that brought it into being . i know it had something to do with too many different programs storing their preferences in too many different places/ways , but as i said that it did n't seem like a very strong argument . there must be a better reason.part b of the question is : how is the registry stored that it is so slow to search ? it seems that no matter how fast your processor is or how fast your hard disk is ( i just got an intel ssd ) , it still takes seconds to search the registry of a virgin xp system ... about as long as it took 10 years ago . what fantastic technology enables this aspect of windows to be immune to cpu & amp ; storage progress ? clarification : i think most people have misinterpreted my question . it seems to me ( and i could be completely wrong ) , that it takes almost as long to do a registry search now as it did a decade ago , which i find surprising given the advances in processing speed . i 'm not advocating registry editing ( although i 've ended up doing more of it than i ever expected over the years ) and i 'm not complaining that it takes too long - i 'm just curious about why the search speed has n't seemed to scale with processing power over the last 10 years or so . i realized that the registry is like this odd black box to me , hence	is this a domain joined workstation with roaming profiles ?	why do you attribute this performance loss to the ssd rather than to , say , the cpu ?	you 're complaining because searching in multiple files takes 10 seconds ! ?	you 're complaining about mere seconds ?	what part of the boot takes long when booting to safe mode ?	is the blu-ray the first device in your boot order ?	what exactly is wrong with uninstallers ?	what does resource monitor show is actually using the drive ?	is the question about ssds in general , or mlc-based ssds in particular ?	is your motherboard a gigabyte brand board ?

hard drive louder in linux when i run linux ( any distribution it seems , fedora 15 , 16 , ubuntu from 2009 to latest version ... ) , the hard drive seem to sound significantly louder . it seems a lot more active when it read/write files , and the clicks it makes are a lot louder . i can actually hear each and individual click . it goes back to normal when i go back to windows 7. in windows , the sound is a light little click if the read/write is long enough , and if i listen for it . in linux , the sound is loud enough for me to hear every click , no matter how long the read/writes are ( well , if it 's really short like a quick little flash of the hdd light , i wo n't hear it , but the read/writes are usually a lot longer than that ) . it also seems that there are a lot more hard drive activity too , such as loading firefox a few seconds after i closed it , and loading pretty much any other program . why is my hard drive louder in linux ? specs - windows 7 professional x64 - fedora 16 x64 - 4gib ddr2 800mhz ram - intel p7450 2.13ghz - fujitsu mhz2320bh g2 320gb , 8mb cache , 5600rpm	any bios updates available for that model ?	only two situations ?	does it give you an option to convert it to a dynamic disk ?	is the default download path set to a : ? or did you last download directly to a : ?	how often did you hear clicks ?	are there any usb ports next to the place you 're plugging in your earbuds ?	does the hard drive spin down / power of then it gets disconnected ? dirty/broken connectors ?	in the bsod what is the stop code ?	has the power supply always made these noises ?	: do you hear any grinding , clanking or scraping noises when the drive spins ?

creating a sound recording pipeline in windows 7 to add effects say i have some program which takes input from an audio recording device ; for example a voip dialer . now i wish to apply a sound effect from a vst plugin to the input device . it seems to me that a sensible way to do this would be to have some vst audio program take input from the mic device , apply the sound effect , write the output to a virtual audio device and have the end program read from the virtual device.if this seems like a logical way to go about the problem , how do i go about creating virtual audio devices in windows 7 , and what vst program would allow me to read live input audio , apply an effect , and write it to the virtual device ? for the latter , i assume there would be many programs capable of this , but i would appreciate a recommendation .	what 's the name of the plugin ?	where is this dialog in os x ?	what os are you using ? windows 7 ?	why do n't you just download the file ?	just for some context - is this one of those systems with a hybrid headphone/mic port ?	just to clarify , the audio sounds bad when played out of the monitor ?	not sure if i understood your question . does it have to be virtual ?	sorry i do n't follow ... so you are trying to stream to or from the dreamhost instance ?	why do n't you just record the input first and apply an effect afterwards ?	ok , so what does it show for your microphone status ?

why is my ntfs parition full when it 's not ? my d : drive of 137gb ( ntfs ) would appear to be full , but i personally disagree . this are the reasons i disagree with reality : selecting all files and viewing their properties , it says 43.4gb size and 43.8gb size on disk . because the size on disk is nearly identical , i do n't think i have a million tiny files filling up sectors.in explorer i show hidden files and also protected system files , so explorer includes as much data as possible when counting the above size and size on disk.viewing the partitions ' contents using 'system ' permissions ( which are above 'administrator ' ) , there are no huge files in system volume information and no other invisible directories.smart has always been enabled and is currently not showing anything weird.the partition/disk does not have anything in the read/write cache . i 've usedsyncand , after that did n't work , also tried rebooting . i did n't do a cold boot ( thatsometimestends to help even if rebooting does n't fix something . should i try that ? ) .the reasons that make me think the disk is full at all is that windows can not create new files ( from explorer nor any scripting/programming language ) , and because when viewing the partition 's properties it reports to have used all 137gb.what might i have missed ? where did all my free space go ? how can i view what 's taking up all the storage space and get rid of it ? when cleaning stuff up , space is indeed freed again and i can reoccupy it with other data . i 've also recently cleaned up a directory	what 's your operating system ?	a `50mb` partition ? are you sure you have n't lost a few zeroes or did you mean `gb` ?	would powershell be of any use ?	did you run windirstat as administrator , so it can check everywhere ?	tried to clean system restore ?	are you using the deduplication feature ?	you overwrote data several times and you expect to restore your files ?	your data + system images equal the size your asking about . so what is the question exactly ?	just wondering , did you make sure the hidden system partition was moved correctly ?	your sector sizes are n't an issue . what does `sgdisk -v /dev/sdd` tell you ?
why are transfer speeds so slow from usb3 sd card to pc ? i guess i 'm trying to pinpoint what chokes the transfer speeds in general : situation is - brand new dell e7240 with usb3.0 ports . copying from a usb3.0 capable card reader ( lexar ) .lots of individual files . crystalmark says my io on the [ ssd ] drive for 1gb files is ~350mb/s at the slowest test ( 450mb/s at the highest ) .copying actual files , maxes out at ~48mb/s . the files are all between 8mb and 50mb a file , and there 's 26gb in total on the sd card.i 've tried using unstoppable copier and changing the copy policy on the reader to `` faster '' and both only increase copy speeds ( each by themselves ) to around 54mb/s tops.my question is this : what factors are the greatest in preventing the copy speeds from reaching the theoretical maximums ? - multiple files ? - usb card quality ? - copy method ? ( i.e . instead of files , just an image of the sd card would be faster as it 's one continuous stream of data ) .any other thoughts / ideas ?	are these regular sd cards or high speed sd cards ?	how are the pc and laptop connected ?

how possible rebooting from linux to windows makes sound from headphones vanish ? i have windows 7 home premium 64bit , dual booting with linux mint . the laptop is asus x54c.the problem : every time i reboot from linux to windows ( restart the computer while on linux , and when grub shows up select windows ) , i have no sound in my headphones until i switch the laptop off . the built-in laptop speakers work fine ; but i hear nothing from my headphones.switching the laptop off and then on again will not invoke the issue . rebooting the laptop from windows to windows will not invoke the issue either . installing sound drivers from asus website or uninstalling them and sticking with basic drivers windows installs itself wont solve the issue . on linux mint , i always have sound from my headphones whether i reboot or not.audio : card intel 6 series/c200 series family high definition audio controller driver : snd_hda_intel bus-id : 00:1b.0 sound : advanced linux sound architecture v : k3.19.0-32-generic	how does the subwoofer plug in ? does sound work properly otherwise ?	sorry , are you saying when the speakers stop working , the headphones remain working fine ?	this is just a shot in the dark but did the on board sound get disabled in the bios ?	what happens if you click the bottom device , then press set default ?	hmmm ... how about in the system / device manager , try to disable and then enable the device ?	you see the bars moving ... .are you sure it 's playing to the correct sound device ?	how do you know if your audio jack isnt causing problems ?	are the headphones in **all** the way ?	just for some context - is this one of those systems with a hybrid headphone/mic port ?	do you see an `` hd audio 2nd output '' tab from the realtek options ?

accidentally set off mode that ignores keyboard input except to toggle actions , windows every once in a while i seem to accidentally chord *something* that puts windows 7 into `` be a total pita '' keyboard mode . it seems to be some kind of special keyboard navigation or command mode , where single keypresses will make the ui do things , e.g. , dtoggles the active window between minimised and unminised . the mouse still works , but i ca n't *use* anything that needs text input anymore . this has happened while using several programs , including minecraft and firefox . i 've been a windows user for a long time , but i 'm not familiar with this behaviour . of course , since i have no idea how pita command mode was activated , i do n't know how to deactivate it either . logging off the windows user and logging back in returns things to normal and is my current solution , but i 'd like to just completely disable this behaviour . i at first assumed it was an accessibility option i 'd left un-disabled , but i already have all the accessibility options turned off . i figured it was maybe a feature of my keyboard ( ms wireless keyboard 3000 v2.0 ) , but i have almost all of the special ( media , etc . ) keys turned off ( in the up-to-date official drive management utility ) and none of the ones still enabled jump out at me as possibly having this effect . i have the win , flip 3d , and application keys disabled . googling for this turned up nothing , but i admit i could n't think of very many text strings i could search	perhaps another test . open notepad , do ctrl-p does a print dialog box appear or not ?	so what 's currently selected in *system preferences language & text input sources* ?	what keyboard layouts and language packs do you have installed ?	does it do it while windows is in safe mode ?	what is `shift+'` supposed to type on your keyboard ?	what 's the laptop model ?	this sounds like the drivers have got corrupted . are there any warnings in device manager ?	can you elaborate on `` strange '' ?	does the issue persist after a restart ?	time for an upgrade ?

custom built computer wo n't turn on anymore ? i built this computer that has been acting quite strange for a while now . at first it would freeze up after 10-30 minutes of playing games ( both low end , and high end games ) . the only way to get it unfrozen was to restart the pc . however , recently the pc started completely turning off out of nowhere , instead of freezing ; and it would not turn back on for a while- the power button would n't work ( unplugging/re-plugging in the power cord had no effect ) . the computer would remain to be non-functional for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before randomly turning itself back on with no interaction from me . ( i would be doing something unrelated to the pc and it would turn on from the other side of the room , without me touching it ) .a week or two ago , it turned itself off once again , but this time still does n't work . buttons on the case have no effect , unplugging the computer for 10+ minutes did n't help either . i even unplugged all parts except for core components , took out the cmos for 15 minutes , and tried to power on the pc again with no luck.there seems to be no power at all going to any of the components . the green light on the motherboard , that usually indicates it 's powered , remains off . absolutely nothing happens when the power button is pushed.i assume the problem is a defunct motherboard , but i do n't want to go buy a new motherboard and have it not be the problem so i 'm checking	anything showing in windows event manager ?	power supply fuse or other fuses blown ?	what is the stop code ?	do you check your power supply ?	this behavior new or has it always happen ?	bad power supply ?	maybe a bad power cord ? bad psu ? no current on wall socket ?	do you have another power supply to test with ?	what is this `` unrelated '' issue ?	what do you mean by `` we have enough power issues '' exactly ?
excel 2010 slow or hangs when does n't have focus running win7 with office 2010. we are seeing a huge slowdown ( 4x to 10x ) running certain excel macros when excel loses focus . for instance a macro that usually runs in 35 seconds slows to 160 seconds if notepad is given focus . i understand that the process that is in focus will get 3x thread time quantums but if it does n't need any processing i would n't think it would block the excel process so badly . is there any way to change the quantum on a process or thread basis in win7 ? i used a free tool `` yet another process monitor '' to zone down on the excel.exe process and all its related threads . boosting its priority as well as all its threads ' priority does n't seem to have any effect . which makes me wonder if there is a way to control the time-quantum for those threads instead ? also , changing the registery does not seem to make any difference either : [ hkey_local_machine \system \currentcontrolset \control \prioritycontrol ] win32priorityseparation = 0 optimize performance for applications : 32 + 4 + 2 = 38 and gives short quantum , variable quantum for foreground , high foreground boost . optimize performance for background services : 16 + 8 + 0 = 24 and gives long quantum , fixed quantum , no foreground boots . help anyone ?	what do you mean by focus ( focus.exe ) exactly ?	what is that system ( os ) and what are the others ? any other difference between them ?	are you accessing these files over a network ? any of these problems on outlook 2007 also ?	are you sure you do n't have problems with your keyboard ?	well , what is this java process exactly ? are you sure it 's supposed to be taking input ?	which laptop you are using ?	did any of these answers work for you mark ?	which feature are you talking about ? would you mind sharing please ?	what os is this ? any idea why the first csrss.exe process was started 1/5/15 and the other 12/10/14 ?	what happens if you do n't set the affinity ?

why is n't my phone charging with some micro usb cables ? i ordered 3 microusb cables over ebay . my phone was at about 50 % battery and i wanted to use it as a hot spot for some browsing on my laptop , so i plugged it in , a charging icon appeared on the phone , my laptop showed it as a connected usb device and so i went about my business.about 30 minutes later i checked the phone and to my dismay saw 45 % battery . but ahh , i thought , i have been putting the poor little thing under too much pressure , acting as a wifi hotspot must drain the battery quicker than it can charge via usb , perhaps even using my laptops usb port would n't output enough power . unscathed i continued on and when i was going to bed i plugged the usb cable into a mains adapter and switched everything battery consuming off and content , went to sleep.the next morning i was awoken by my phones alarm which got cut off unexpectedly . i attempted to unlock my phone which showed no more signs of life.why is n't my phone charging with these new usb cables ? for clarity : they transfer data with no problemsthe phone appears to be charging , showing all the signs and lights it normally would , the cable that came with the phone works as you would expect , so its not a fault with the phone , ithinktheyslowthe discharging of the phone , but i could be wrong.are these just bad quality cables ? is there a way to fix this issue ?	do you have a multimeter ?	does it charge if you turn it off or when you connect it to another power source ?	does that virtual xp instance have the palm software installed ?	how did you connect nokia 2690 to your computer ?	do all cables in question have all connectors available ?	could you clarify abit , why this could be useless ?	does it work any better if you do the same thing in the bios setup ?	is the software open source ?	what color is the plastic part inside the port ?	are you connecting just to charge the battery or for another purpose , like data transfer ?

how am i exceeding usb 2.0 speeds on a usb 2.0 port ? i am writing files to a usb 2.0 drive from a ram disk , that has a 256mb random filled file on it ( created from /dev/urandom to stop the file being compressed too much ) . when i look at the speeds of the file writes which is output fromdd , they are averaging around 75mb/s . this is particularly interesting , because the theoretical maximum speed of usb 2.0 is 60mb/s.the command that i 'm running is : dd if=/var/mnt/temp_data/urandom of=/mnt/usb/ $ file_name bs=10m count=1note that i 'm running this multiple times , and i fill the drive to 95 % full . the reason for the 10mb files is to make sure that the drive is pretty close to 95 % full , and i would n't get that sort of fill with larger files , as i do n't know what size memory stick will be plugged in , and having multiple files is part of the test.if motives affect write speed , what i 'm doing is testing the write speed of the usb ports on a system to see if they conform to usb standards . hence this being relatively distressing , and the filling from /dev/urandom ( indirectly ) .so why is this happening and how do i fix it ? i'massumingthat the measurements thatddis outputting is inaccurate , otherwise i 'll start selling usb driver writers my secrets .

tmux xclip copy no longer working on mu ubuntu 12.04 setups my tmux clipboard copy and paste commands are setup as follows : set -g prefix m-a unbind c-b bind c-c run `` tmux save-buffer - | xclip -i -sel clipboard '' bind c-v run `` tmux set-buffer \ '' $ ( xclip -o -sel clipboard ) \ '' ; tmux paste-buffer '' this worked great for the longest time up until a month or so ago , when i suspect some configuration change or package change was made that broke the above . in gnome terminal , pasting still works fine with both prefix + c-v and ctrl-shift-v.however the xclip copy command no longer works no matter what i do , and i have tried removing the custom prefix binding above , using -select instead of -sel , not using `` clipboard '' etc . this is pretty much a show stopper for a gvim user like me , since i do n't even have the gnome terminal workaround of ctrl-shift-c with tmux taking over the shell . i go into copy mode , select text with space + movement , and when i execute prefix + c-c absolutely nothing happens . before this broke , tmux would display a confirmation message in the notification section at the bottom.does anybody have suggestions as far as how one might debug this ? this is a pretty big productivity hit . i can probably use thetemporary file workaround trick for now , but it 'd be great to know just what happened to xclip .	is xclip actually available ? what is the output of `type xclip` ?	does shift+insert to paste work ?	can you update your question with your $ term in and outside tmux ?	are you using wayland ?	does middle click not work in gedit ?	is emacs running on the same machine as tmux , or are you running emacs over ssh ?	does n't merely your ubuntu terminal support copy/paste ? how are you ssh'ing ?	what are `cat |` in the last version of your commands for ?	and are you exporting a term anywhere in your shell .rc files ?	when you say *real text-mode console* do you mean a command prompt in a terminal ?

how to start up k=10 apache2 server processes upon ubuntu 16.04 alpha release reboot ? i would like to know how to start up k=10 apache2 server processes upon ubuntu 16.04 alpha release reboot . yesterday , i read this url , [ https : //rudd-o.com/linux-and-free-software/tuning-an-apache-server-in-5-minutes ] , which says to use apache2 with the prefork.c module and set startservers equal to 10 & lt ; ifmodule prefork.c & gt ; startservers 4 minspareservers 3 maxspareservers 10 serverlimit 256 maxclients 256 maxrequestsperchild 10000 & lt ; /ifmodule & gt ; unfortunately , my apache2 only has the event.c module . i tried upgrading apache2 to the prefork.c module with sudo apt-get install apache-mtm-prefork and the install error said no such package available because it may be outdated or obsolete . then i tried sudo apt-get update and i received the same error message.my next step was to try to configure the apache2 event module with startservers = 5 by changing /etc/httpd.conf and then restarting my systemd apache.service file and my ps -ef | grep -in `` apache2 '' shows only 2 www-data apache2 processes and ps-ef | grep -in `` mod '' shows no mod-mono-server4 process.furthermore , upon running apache2 at the bash shell command prompt it said syntax error apache2_lock_file environment variable missing . i discovered that apache2_lock_file is defined in my /etc/apache2/envvars file.the ubuntu 16.04 apache2 man page says , `` in general , apache2 should not be invoked directly , but rather should be invoked via /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . the default debian configuration requires environment variables that are defined in /etc/apache2/envvars and are not available if apache2 is started directly . however , apache2ctl can be used to pass arbitrary arguments to apache2 . `` so i could use /etc/apache2/envars , i edited my systemd apache.service	could you paste the contents of `/etc/init.d/apache2` file ?	_does_ the apache error log have more information as suggested by the error message ?	is the access log for your virtualhost seeing any traffic ?	what 's the value of the `listen` directive in the config file ?	can you provide some output from your attempts to install or start ?	do you have out-of-band ( i.e . non-ssh ) access ? `ifdown`/`ifup` / restart networking ?	lot 's of information here , but what about your apache error logs ?	that 's odd . can you post the script `/etc/init.d/apache2` in your question ?	where is the output of the netstat ?	by `` k=10 servers '' are you just asking about starting `` 10 servers '' ?

transfer 150gb of files from an old macbook pro with ubuntu 13.04 live dvd my girlfriend 's old macbook pro 2009 ( 5,4 ) stopped working . i have tried several times to reinstall os x , but could not do so . there appears to be something really really wrong with the os.since she is not opposed to the idea of using ubuntu instead of os x , i am currently trying to transfer all of her files to my linux machine using an ethernet crossover cable.since os x does not work at all , i am using the ubuntu 13.04 live dvd to access her files.at first i thought the job would be simple . my plan was to set up network interfaces , plug in the crossover cable , set up an nfs share on the macintosh hd , andrsyncall 150gb of her files over to my machine . then install ubuntu 13.04 as the sole operating system , and transfer the files back over.but , alas , things are not that simple . nfs does n't seem to like apple 's hfs+ filesystem . at least , i can not get it to work . i also can not find information about how to configure it . since all of that takes time , i 'm wondering if there 's a simpler , better solution.i thought of using anrsyncdaemon , but since both computers are running ubuntu ( the client is using 12.10 ) , and since i can mount the hfs+ hard drive in order to browse through her files , and since both computers canpingeach other , it just seemed like there would be an easier way to do this than trying to configure nfs .	how are you sharing the user credentials ( authentication , group membership , ... ) between the two machines ?	nfsv2 is pretty old . what os are you using ?	why not just let ubuntu update itself rather than use the dvds ?	you realize that without a reproducible test case , you 're asking for speculation here , right ?	why not have a vm for each distro you are curious about ?	is an ssh server running on the target machine ? is the ssh port open ( not firewalled ) ?	why not just rsync via ssh or native rsync ?	why do you want to do this via live system ?	are these both unix machines ?	what makes `find` faster than `rsync` ?
timestamp of newly created file is in the future on my machine at work i experience weird timestamps of files . this is bothering me , because it messes withmake.to reproduce the issue , this suffices : $ touch foo $ stat -c % y foo 2014-01-31 16:38:51.000000000 +0100 $ date fr 31. jan 16:14:59 cet 2014as you can see , the file , although just created , has a timestamp that is roughly 24 minutes in the future . to be precise , it is fairly stable at 24 minutes and 8 seconds , which is 1448 seconds , to me a seemingly arbitrary number.the same holds for directories freshly created withmkdiror simply any kind of file saving / creating stuff.our administrator is fairly unresponsive and did n't gave root permissions either . what might be the cause of this issue and how to deal with it , if possible without root ?	what is the required resolution , accuracy and why do you need it/what are you using it for ?	can you please share some of your code ?	what is the cost of changing the way the second timestamp is displayed ?	is the filesystem local or remote ?	how was the `crontab` file edited ?	is there any use in showing more than two or three input blocks ?	is your file system mounted with something funny ? are you using acl 's ?	what is the offset if you do `date + % s ; date` ?	anything in `dmesg` ?	what does `type date` return ? could it possibly be aliased ? what about `strace -fe open date` ?
random application crashes in linux sometimes after booting my computer , some applications fail to start : they crash . they 're usually the largest ones , such as firefox , thunderbird or virtualbox . rebooting or cleaning the cache usually solves the problem . for example : me @ localhost : ~ $ thunderbird & amp ; segmentation fault me @ localhost : ~ $ echo 3 & gt ; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches me @ localhost : ~ $ thunderbird & amp ; [ 1 ] 6709i 've also noticed that those applications binaries or related libraries have different md5sums before and after dropping the caches . i even compared the binaries ' hexdumps and found one byte difference between them.this happens with different linux distributions and versions . i 've run memtest plenty of times , replaced my hard disk with another one ( same model , though ) and nothing changed . this hardware is some years old and pretty common , but this has been happening all the time since i got it , so i do n't think it is unsupported.what could i do to find the cause of this problem ? thanks in advance .	does the thunderbird trash directory get cleared after the app restarts ?	what about security issues ?	maybe the distros have been compiled with the `gcc` version they contain ?	does /lib/ld-linux.so.2 exist ? is the architecture of the libraries x86/amd64 matching the downloaded version ?	what kind of gpu does it have ?	do you have the same problem with another account ? with a different desktop environment ?	are the lvm system services running ?	are you getting `oom` messages in syslog ?	can you `umount` filesystem ( s ) ?	which version of windows ?

in which file is hostname alias persistent , if not /etc/hosts ? in order to have an alias for my server , which can be seen in a `` hostname -a '' command , i edited the /etc/hosts file to add the alias at the end of the entry containing the hostname.for example , my hostname is host1 and i want to have alias hostalias , i have below entry in /etc/hosts:192.168.0.1 host1 hostaliaswith this change i am able to use `` hostname -a '' to see hostalias.however , i can change it only once ! if i edit the file /etc/hosts again to something like this:192.168.0.1 host1 hostalias2the output of `` hostname -a '' is still hostalias.even after i remove the hostalias2 and reboot the server , it 's still saying hostalias.but , if i change the alias the first time after reboot , it takes effect.so in fact i have two questions : where is the hostname alias persistent , if not /etc/hosts ( so it can survive a reboot ) .why can it only be changed once per boot ? more information : it is a rhel 6.2 server .	what linux distribution and version are you running ?	which operating system ?	does your virtual machine use dhcp ? how are you checking the hostname - via the `hostname` command ?	what does your `/etc/hosts` file contain ? also what does `sysctl kernel.hostname` say ?	can you include the configuration file here ?	what happens when you type `localhost` in the address bar ?	are you using dynamic dhcp so you get a new ip address each time it reboots ?	can you at least post the `` host '' syntax you are using ?	were you going to share your current ` $ ps1` with us ?	is reverse lookup for kdc working via dns ?

why does history not overwrite but append when histappend is set to off in bash ? several days ago , i had one terminal tab doingssh , and the other doing a lot of work locally . and then i restarted the machine ( on a mac with mavericks ) .when i ran terminal again , i found that all the command history of the 2nd tab was not there . there was only thesshcommand.so then i searched for how to `` merge '' the history somehow , and found that we need to do ashopt -s histappendin our~/.bashrcfile so that history will append , instead of `` overwrite '' -- we do n't want one set of history overwriting the other set ; we want to append.however , when i go to the os x yosemite box , and usedshopt , i saw thathistappendis off , but when i opened up two tabs , one doingecho abc , and the other doingecho def , and exited them , i re-opened terminal again and issued ahistorycommand , and saw both theecho abcandecho defcommands.and then i ran ubuntu 2014-10 on virtualbox and did similar things , and still saw both history recorded ( i first ranshopt -u histappendin both bash to set the option to off first ) .so what mechanism is doing that really ? thenhistappendhas no significance , if setting it to on or off does n't matter ? i also commented out theshopt -s histappendin my.bashrcand restarted terminal and tried again , and saw the history of both tabs able to combine ... so this is really strange behavior and what can be causing it ?	`eval history -s `` # $ ( date + % s ) '' ` ? ?	what happens if you send sighup instead of sigkill ?	is using zsh an option ?	what about gnu `screen` ?	what 's the output of `stty -a` ?	what is your `prompt_command` ?	what terminal emulator are you using ?	are those spaces literally there ?	if you do a `history | wc -l` , how many lines are shown ?	how do you run bash ?

opening files of size larger than ram , no swap used . i found myself asking this question while doing small experiments and reading upon how memory is managed in linux.i have a 64-bit centos 6.5 machine with 512m ram and 1g swap . i created a 1gb file '/mytest ' ( usingdd ) and opened the file withvi . once the file was completely opened , i opened another terminal to look at the memory usage . as expected , thevishowed up at the top when thetopoutput is ordered by memory usage . so i checkedfree -mexpecting to see the swap usage going up , but to my surprise , the swap usage is nil . since the size of the file opened is twice the size of ram , where is the file being held in memory ?

putty works extremely bad with vps problem brief : extremely slow and unreliable connection using putty while apache server works fine.i have a vps with centos 6 installed and putty ssh client running on windows7 64 bit at home . the problem is that putty works extremely slow and connection often drops . sometimes i have to wait few minutes to get a responce ( if i get any at all ) thus working process is extremely inconvenient . same problem also has ftp server vsftpd.but the apache server ( httpd ) running on the same vps shows excelent performance and always responds very quickly . one more strange thing : if any task with long execution time ( for example wget or make ) has been launched , putty 's output is always quick and connection never drops.any suggestions ? i think about two possible reasons : priority of ssh and sftp server is lowsome unknown specifics of vpsi am not familiar with linux close enough and would like to hear any suggestions to solve this annoying problem . also it is interesting if anybody has similar problem .	does connecting include telnet ?	can you share the putty event log ?	is there anything non-vanilla about your home directory ?	does the same slowness occur if you ssh from a linux machine to your vps ?	not directly what you are asking but how about just pressing `ctrl+d` multiple times ?	i 've reformatted the question . can you check if my edits are okay ?	is sshd really listening that port for the network interface ?	can you post full ssh log ?	can i ask why you 're running ssh over an https proxy ?	numbers are technically text ; can you show an example of the difference ?

is there a solution for when a system hangs on `` switching to clocksource tsc '' anyway ? ok so this is exactly what i did yesterday , and what i have tried to solve the problem so far . the distribution isubuntu server 12.04.what i have done just before the error appearedi added a new upstart file in/etc/initi rebooted the system to see if the script workedthe script did not work , so i edited it and rebooted againwhat is happeningand that 's where havoc began . i tried sshing into the machine only to be greeted by error messages about not being able to connect . so i go on the server itself and i see that the boot process is hanging atswitching to clocksource tsc . i hear the machine working but nothing happens , not even if i leave the server sitting for minutes . the only thing i seem to be able to do is to launch recovery mode.what i have tried so fari have googled around a while but nothing seems to solve this problem . also , in many discussions i have read that users have not been able to solve this , so i am starting to lose hope.what i have tried so far : booted into recovery mode , accesses a root shell and deleted the upstart scripttook out my nvidia graphics card ( one of the discussions i have read online seemed to hint at a problem with this ) and used the integrated graphics cardsudo apt-get update & amp ; & amp ; apt-get upgrade , just to make sure there were n't any broken packages or missing dependenciessudo apt-get dist-upgrade , just to make sure it was n't a kernel problemedited/boot/grub/grub.cfgaddingclocksource=hpetto the ubuntu menu itemedited/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource ' fromtsctohpet`uninstalled all	is `sed` not easy or elegant ?	do you have a `/var/log/syslog` ?	what distro are you running ?	and , did this start right after installing the nvidia drivers ?	can you post the exact error message ?	can you successfully bring the box up using the virtaulbox gui ( virtualbox on my ubuntu desktop ) ?	what does `/var/log/messages` say for the failed boots ?	is it `/bin` you chmoded or the files in `/bin` or both ?	are you using nouveau or proprietary drivers ? is your integrated gpu from intel ?	is the default in `/etc/inittab` set to `3` or `5` ?
